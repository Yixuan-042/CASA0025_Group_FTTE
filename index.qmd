## Project Summary 

Fill in the sections below to provide a brief summary of your project. Each section should have no more than 100 words. Do not edit any of the headings.

### Problem Statement 

What is the problem you’re trying to address using this application? 

### End User 

Who are you building this application for? How does it address a need this community has?

### Data

CO₂ Emissions Data:
Annual CO₂ emissions data is sourced from the ODIAC 2023 dataset (ODIAC 2023). Historical emissions from 2018 to 2022 are also included to support temporal trend analysis.

Land Cover Data:
Land cover classification is generated using Landsat 9 Surface Reflectance imagery and ESA WorldCover 2021 as training labels. A Random Forest model is trained and applied in Google Earth Engine to produce a 30-meter resolution land cover map.

Population Data:
Population data is provided by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, offering 1 km × 1 km gridded raster data for China, supporting demographic and spatial distribution analysis.

Nighttime Light Data:
Nighttime light intensity for 2023 is processed using monthly VIIRS DNB composites in Google Earth Engine. The data is aggregated to produce a 100-meter resolution raster clipped to the Guangzhou boundary.

Building Characteristics Data:
Building data is sourced from Gaode Map’s 3D Map API (Gaode Map 3D), including building height, footprint area, and gross internal area (GIA) for urban morphology analysis.

## How it Works 

Use this section to explain how your application works using code blocks and text explanations (no more than 500 words excluding code):

## Application Overview

This application is designed for interactive environmental analysis using Google Earth Engine (GEE).  
It integrates multiple geospatial datasets, builds thematic visualizations, and applies machine learning models to predict CO₂ emissions under various landcover scenarios.

## Data Loading and Preprocessing

The first step imports core datasets including district boundaries, population density, nighttime light intensity, building statistics, and CO₂ emission rasters for the years 2017–2023.

```js
var districts = ee.FeatureCollection('users/.../GZ_boundaries');
var populationFC = ee.FeatureCollection('projects/.../population0422');
var ntlFC = ee.FeatureCollection('projects/.../NTL0422');
var buildingStats = ee.FeatureCollection('projects/.../BuildingGrid0424');
var co2Paths = { 2017: 'users/.../2017co2', ..., 2023: 'users/.../2023co2' };
Map.centerObject(districts, 9);

 

---


```js
Map.setCenter(35.51898, 33.90153, 15);

Map.setOptions("satellite");

var aoi = ee.Geometry.Point(35.51898, 33.90153).buffer(3000);
```

You can include images:

and math:
$$ \Large t = {\frac{\overline{x_1}-\overline{x_2}} {\sqrt{\frac{s^2_1}{n_1} + \frac{s^2_2}{n_2}}}} $$
