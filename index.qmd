#  CO₂ Emission Analysis and Projections in Guangzhou, China

## Project Summary 

### Problem Statement 

As the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide (CO2), China faces significant challenges in addressing climate change. With cities contributing over 70% of global energy-related CO2 emissions, understanding urban emission patterns is crucial. We selected Guangzhou as our study area due to its economic significance in the Greater Bay Area, rapid urbanization, and diverse land use patterns. This application explores relationships between nighttime lights, population, land cover, and building characteristics with CO2 emissions to identify key emission drivers and support evidence-based carbon reduction policies in rapidly developing Chinese cities.

### End User 

This application is designed for urban planners, policymakers, and environmental researchers focused on Guangzhou's central districts. These stakeholders need evidence-based tools to understand CO2 emission patterns and their driving factors within the urban core. By providing spatial visualization of emission and identifying relationships between urban characteristics and carbon emissions in central Guangzhou, our tool helps users develop targeted mitigation strategies for high-density areas, evaluate potential impacts of urban redevelopment projects, and monitor progress toward local carbon reduction goals. The interactive interface allows decision-makers to explore complex environmental data specifically for Guangzhou's urban center.

### Data

CO₂ Emissions Data:
Annual CO₂ emissions data is sourced from the ODIAC 2023 dataset (ODIAC 2023). Historical emissions from 2017 to 2022 are also included to support temporal trend analysis.

Land Cover Data:
Land cover classification is generated using Landsat 9 Surface Reflectance imagery and ESA WorldCover 2021 as training labels. A Random Forest model is trained and applied in Google Earth Engine to produce a 30-meter resolution land cover map.

Population Data:
Population data is provided by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, offering 1 km × 1 km gridded raster data for China, supporting demographic and spatial distribution analysis.

Nighttime Light Data:
Nighttime light intensity for 2023 is processed using monthly VIIRS DNB composites in Google Earth Engine. The data is aggregated to produce a 100-meter resolution raster clipped to the Guangzhou boundary.

Building Characteristics Data:
Building data is sourced from Gaode Map’s 3D Map API (Gaode Map 3D), including building height, footprint area, and gross internal area (GIA) for urban morphology analysis.

### Methodology

Data Preprocessing: Clip and project CO2 emissions, landcover types, building coverage, population, and nighttime light data in Guangzhou to create uniform raster files.
Model Construction: Employ Random Forest with CO2 emissions as the dependent variable and the rest of data as independent variables. The model is constructed for the six districts in the central Guangzhou by conducting regression analysis after screening the independent variables by colinearity.
Visualization and Prediction: Design layers to display CO2 emissions distribution. Use the regression model to simulate urban densification effects, by adjusting land cover proportions to forecast future emissions.

### Interface

This application provides urban planners and researchers with an intuitive interactive dashboard. Users can switch between thematic layers (population density, night lighting, architectural features, land cover, carbon dioxide emissions) through the drop-down menu and view detailed pixel-level information by clicking on the map. Dynamic charts can visually display the emission trends and spatial distribution of various regions. The prediction module enables users to simulate land cover changes and assess potential CO₂ impacts. The clarity and real-time interactivity of the interface enable decision-makers to explore the complex urban environmental relationships in Guangzhou and support targeted carbon reduction strategies.

## How it Works 

### Application Overview

This application is designed for interactive environmental analysis using Google Earth Engine (GEE). It integrates multiple geospatial datasets, builds thematic visualizations, and applies machine learning models to predict CO₂ emissions under various landcover scenarios.

### 1. Data Loading and Preprocessing

#### 1.1 Core Dataset Import

The first step imports core datasets including district boundaries, population density, nighttime light intensity, building statistics, and CO₂ emission rasters for the years 2017–2023.

```js
var districts = ee.FeatureCollection('users/.../GZ_boundaries');
var populationFC = ee.FeatureCollection('projects/.../population0422');
var ntlFC = ee.FeatureCollection('projects/.../NTL0422');
var buildingStats = ee.FeatureCollection('projects/.../BuildingGrid0424');
var co2Paths = { 2017: 'users/.../2017co2', ..., 2023: 'users/.../2023co2' };
Map.centerObject(districts, 9);
```
A boundary layer is added to the map, ensuring district outlines remain on top of all visualizations.

#### 1.2 Landcover Classification

Landsat 9 imagery combined with ESA WorldCover data is used to train a Random Forest classifier. 
The resulting landcover classification is simplified into seven categories to enhance visualization clarity.

```js
var composite = landsat9.median().clip(districts);
var samples = composite.addBands(esa).sample({ ... });
var classifier = ee.Classifier.smileRandomForest(50).train({ ... });
var classified = composite.classify(classifier).remap([10,20,...],[0,1,...]);
```

#### 1.3 CO₂ Emissions Visualization

The application visualizes CO₂ emissions dynamically across different years. A dropdown menu allows users to switch between annual layers, and charts provide both citywide trends and district-level distributions.

```js
var co2Images = years.reduce(function(obj, y) {
  obj[y] = ee.Image(co2Paths[y]);
  return obj;
}, {});
Map.layers().set(2, ui.Map.Layer(co2Images[2023], visParamsCO2, 'CO₂ Emission'));
```

### 2. Interactive Thematic Layers and Panels

#### 2.1 Thematic Layers and Interaction

A thematic selector enables users to switch between layers such as population density, nighttime lights, and building characteristics.
Clicking on the map displays real-time attribute values for the selected theme.

```js
var visParamsDict = {
  'Population Density': { image: popMasked, vis: {min: 0, max: 5000, palette: [...]}, units: 'people/km²' },
  'Nighttime Lights': { ... },
  ...
};
selector.onChange(function(key) { ... });
Map.onClick(function(coords) { ... });
```

#### 2.2 Layer and Legend Management

This section describes how different data layers are managed and visualized within the application, ensuring a seamless interactive experience. A unified legend style is dynamically generated to accompany each thematic layer.

- **Administrative boundary layer:** always on top.
- **Land cover map:** 7 categories of land based on training outputs
- **CO₂ emission layer:** default 2023, supports year switching
- **Other thematic layers:** selector switching, automatic legend refreshing
- createLegend function generates a unified style legend (supports custom units/colors)

#### 2.3 Interactive Panels

- **The CO₂ panel in the upper right corner contains:**
  - Year selector
  - Line chart of city average trends
  - Bar chart by district (automatically updated by year)
- **The left synthesized panel contains:**
  - Theme layer selector
  - Dynamically updated legend
  - Pie chart of land cover proportions in 2023
- Real-time sampling and display of pixel values and units when clicking on the map.

### 3. Predictive Modeling with Random Forest

This project uses a Random Forest model to predict CO₂ emissions from urban features. 
Users select landcover change scenarios (e.g., Built-up to Forest), apply changes, and the model automatically re-predicts CO₂ emissions based on the updated features, showing spatial impacts and emission percentage changes.
The model focuses on the city’s core districts to ensure higher prediction accuracy and computational efficiency.

```js
// Feature engineering
var combo4Features = [
  'MeanHeight', 'population', 'density', 'BuiCover',
  'lc_10', 'lc_20', 'lc_30', 'lc_40', 'lc_50', 'lc_60', 'lc_80'
];

// Restricting the scope of reasoning to the central city
var coreDistricts = districts.filter(ee.Filter.inList('ENG_NAME',[
  'Tianhe', 'Yuexiu', 'Haizhu', 'Liwan', 'Baiyun', 'Huangpu'
]));

// Training Random Forests
var samples = featureImg.sample({
  region: coreDistricts.geometry(),
  scale: 1000,
  numPixels: 2000,
  seed: 42,
  geometries: true
}).filter(ee.Filter.notNull(combo4Features));

var rf = ee.Classifier.smileRandomForest(100)
  .setOutputMode('REGRESSION')
  .train({
    features: samples,
    classProperty: 'RASTERVALU',
    inputProperties: combo4Features
  });

// Predict raw baseline
var baselinePred = featureImg.select(combo4Features).classify(rf);

// Drop-down box for selecting scenarios
var scenarioSelect = ui.Select({
  items: [
    'Built-up ➔ Greenplace (20%)',
    'Bare ➔ Built-up (20%)',
    'Cropland ➔ Forest (50%)',
  ],
  style: {
    stretch: 'horizontal',
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    fontSize: '14px'
  }
});

var applyButton = ui.Button({
  label: 'Apply Change & Predict',
  style: {stretch: 'horizontal', fontWeight: 'bold'},
  onClick: function() {
    var selected = scenarioSelect.getValue();
    var percentage;
    var modifiedLandcover = landcoverImg;
    
    if (selected === 'Built-up ➔ Greenplace (20%)') {
      percentage = 0.2;
      modifiedLandcover = landcoverImg.where(
        landcoverImg.eq(50).and(ee.Image.random().lt(percentage)),
        10
      );
    }
    if (selected === 'Bare ➔ Built-up (20%)') {
      percentage = 0.2;
      modifiedLandcover = landcoverImg.where(
        landcoverImg.eq(40).and(ee.Image.random().lt(percentage)),
        50
      );
    }
    if (selected === 'Cropland ➔ Forest (50%)') {
      percentage = 0.5;
      modifiedLandcover = landcoverImg.where(
        landcoverImg.eq(60).and(ee.Image.random().lt(percentage)),
        20
      );
    }
```
